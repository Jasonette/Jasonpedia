# How does this work?
This repo publishes to `https://jasonette.github.io/Jasonpedia`.

For example the [hello.json](https://github.com/Jasonette/Jasonpedia/blob/gh-pages/hello.json) file in the root directory is directly available at [https://jasonette.github.io/Jasonpedia/hello.json](https://jasonette.github.io/Jasonpedia/hello.json).

So is every other file in this repo.
